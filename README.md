# hello-world
first created repository for learning github

This is the first time I am using GitHub, learning about the various functions available to the user. I have been doing CS50x online and it uses git to submit assignments. I was advised by mentors to learn to use Git and GitHub as they will be invaluable tools as I learn the skills needed to become a developer.
